# Suggested Development Phases:

## Week 1-2:

### System Design: 
Define the roles and interactions of different agents (responders, supply vehicles, shelters, civilians). Decide on communication protocols for resource requests, coordination, and status updates.
### Basic Implementation: 
Implement a simple version of the system with responder and civilian agents. Responder agents should respond to requests for help from civilian agents.

## Week 3:

### Resource Management: 
Introduce supply vehicle agents responsible for delivering resources (e.g., food, water, medical aid) to shelters and affected areas. Implement basic route optimization algorithms for supply agents.
### Dynamic Environment: 
Simulate dynamic conditions such as roadblocks or new disaster zones emerging over time. Agents should be able to reroute and adjust their priorities in response to these changes.

## Week 4:

### Shelter Management: 
Implement shelter agents that track their capacity (number of civilians they can accommodate) and request resources from supply vehicle agents based on their current needs.
### Collaboration Mechanism: 
Introduce protocols for collaboration and negotiation among agents. For example, responder agents can communicate with supply vehicle agents to prioritize deliveries to critical areas.

## Week 5:

### Advanced Decision-Making: 
Enhance agent behavior to handle complex decision-making, such as balancing resource allocation between multiple affected areas or deciding when to evacuate civilians versus delivering supplies.

### System Resilience: 
Implement mechanisms for agents to handle system failures or partial information (e.g., disrupted communication between agents). Agents should be able to continue operating with degraded information.

## Week 6:

### User Interface and Visualization:
Create a user interface to visualize the disaster area, agent movements, resource allocation, and key metrics like rescue operations and supply delivery efficiency.

### Testing and Performance Evaluation: 
Test the system in various disaster scenarios, including different sizes of affected areas, varying severity levels, and dynamic events. Evaluate performance using the predefined metrics and fine-tune agent behavior.
